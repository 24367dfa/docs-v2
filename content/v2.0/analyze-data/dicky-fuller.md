Dicky Fuller (DF) tests for the covariance stationarity in data. Augmented Dicky Fuller test (ADF-test) tests for stationarity while considering time dependencies. Covariance stationarity is detected in time series data when the following conditions are true:

- Series has a constant mean
- Series has a constant variance
- Series has a constant covariance between time intervals
