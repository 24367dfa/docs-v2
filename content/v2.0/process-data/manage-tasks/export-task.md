InfluxDB allows you to export tasks from the InfluxDB user interface (UI).
Tasks are exported as downloadable JSON files.

To export a task:

## Delete a task in the InfluxDB UI
1. Click the **Tasks** icon in the left navigation menu.

    {{< nav-icon "tasks" >}}

2. In the list of tasks, hover over the task you would like to export and click
   the **{{< icon "gear" >}}** that appears.
3. Select **Export**.
4. Click **Download JSON** to download the exported JSON file or copy and paste
   the raw JSON into your local text editor and save.
