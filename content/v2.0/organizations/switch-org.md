Use the InfluxDB user interface (UI) to switch from one organization to another. The organization you're currently viewing determines what dashboards, tasks, buckets, members, and other assets you can access.

## Switch organizations in the InfluxDB UI

1. Click the **Influx** icon in the navigation bar.

    {{< nav-icon "admin" >}}

2. Select **Switch Organizations**. The list of organizations appears.
3. Click the organization you want to switch to.
