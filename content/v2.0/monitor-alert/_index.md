Monitor your time series data and send alerts by creating checks, notification rules, and notification endpoints. To get started, do the following:

1. [Create checks](...create-a-check) to monitor data for a specified check status.
2. (Optional) Send alerts on a specified check status by doing the following:

      a. [Create a notification endpoint](/v2.0/monitor-alert/notification-endpoints/create).

      b. [Create notification rules](/v2.0/monitor-alert/notification-rules/create).

After creating your initial checks and notifications, adjust how you monitor data and alerts as needed. For more information, see:

- [Manage checks](/v2.0/cloud/monitor-alert/manage-checks)
- [Manage notification rules](/v2.0/monitor-alert/notification-rules)
- [Manage notification endpoints](/v2.0/monitor-alert/notification-endpoints)
