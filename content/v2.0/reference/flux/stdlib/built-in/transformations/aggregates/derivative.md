The `derivative()` function computes the rate of change per [`unit`](#unit) of time between subsequent non-null records.
It assumes rows are ordered by the `_time` column.
The output table schema is the same as the input table.

_**Function type:** Aggregate_  
_**Output data type:** Float_

```js
derivative(
  unit: 1s,
  nonNegative: false,
  columns: ["_value"],
  timeSrc: "_time"
)
```

## Parameters

### unit
The time duration used when creating the derivative.
Defaults to `1s`.

_**Data type:** Duration_

### nonNegative
Indicates if the derivative is allowed to be negative.
When set to `true`, if a value is less than the previous value, it is assumed the previous value should have been a zero.

_**Data type:** Boolean_

### columns
The columns to use to compute the derivative.
Defaults to `["_value"]`.

_**Data type:** String_

### timeSrc
The column containing time values.
Defaults to `"_time"`.

_**Data type:** String_

## Examples
```js
from(bucket: "example-bucket")
  |> range(start: -5m)
  |> derivative(unit: 1s, nonNegative: true)
```
