Influx Templates are prepackaged InfluxDB configurations that contain everything
from dashboards and Telegraf configurations to notifications and alerts in a single manifest file.
Use Influx Templates to quickly set up a fresh instance of InfluxDB, backup your
dashboard configuration, or share your configuration with the InfluxData community.
