If you're an InfluxDB Cloud user, you'll need the InfluxDB CLI (`influx`) to run `pkg` commands against your Cloud account. 

InfluxDB OSS 2.0 includes the InfluxDB CLI (`influx`). If you havenâ€™t already, do the following:

- [Install OSS 2.0](/v2.0/get-started/#start-with-influxdb-oss).
- [Set up and use InfluxDB CLI](/v2.0/reference/cli/influx/) with the appropriate InfluxDB Cloud instance URL, organization, and tokens associated with your account.

Next, discover how to use `influx` and `pkg` to do the following:
- [Create templates](/v2.0/influxdb-templates/create/)
- [Use templates](/v2.0/influxdb-templates/use/)
